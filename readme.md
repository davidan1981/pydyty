pydyty is an automatic type documentation tool for Python. It monkey patches
code to monitors function calls during which type information is collected
by the patched code. Finally, it further processes the information and
finally generates type documentation.

No guarantee of any kind whatsoever. Do not trust the types inferred by this
tool with your life. It is meant to be heuristic, intuitive, and fun, not
sound or complete. If you want to prove soundness or completeness of any
kind, go to grad school.

This project is still in progress.
